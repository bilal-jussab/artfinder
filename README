# README Text Search Engine

## Description:
This Python script creates a simple text search engine.
It reads all text files in a specified directory, creates an in-memory index of the files and their contents, and provides an interactive search prompt.
The user can input search queries, and the script will return the filenames with the highest matching scores based on the query.

## Features:
- Reads text files in a specified directory.
- Builds an index of words and filenames.
- Provides an interactive search prompt.
- Displays filenames along with their corresponding match scores.
- Supports quitting the search prompt with `:quit` command.

## Usage:
1. **Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Python 3.6.9 was used when building this.
2. **Clone Repository**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. **Navigate to Directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. **Run Script**: Execute the script by running the command `python <filename> <pathToDirectoryContainingTextFiles>`.
   - Example: `python text_search.py /path/to/text/files`.
5. **Search**: Enter your search query when prompted with `search>`.
6. **Quit**: To exit the search prompt, type `:quit`.
